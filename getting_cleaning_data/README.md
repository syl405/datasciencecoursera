"run_analysis.r" cleans the HAR dataset from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository to produce a tidy, summarized version. Different variables and identifiers are originally stored in separate text files. The script reads these files into R and combines them into a single data frame where each column represents a single variable. In addition, the training and test datasets are merged while only the mean and standard deviation values for each measurement are retained. Activities and variables (measurements) are labelled with descriptive names supplied in the original code book. Finally, a separate dataset is created by splitting the observations by the interaction of subject and activity variables (to obtain summary statistics for each activity done by each subject) and taking the arithmetic mean of each variable.
