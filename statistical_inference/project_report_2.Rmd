# Project Report - Statistical Inference on ToothGrowth dataset
Course: Statistical Inference
Author: Shien Yang Lee

## Exploratory Analysis
The ToothGrowth dataset is included in the datasets package of R. The dataset contains data from a scientific study in which the response is the length of odontoblasts (teeth) in each of 10 guinea pigs at each of three dose levels of Vitamin C (0.5, 1, and 2 mg) with each of two delivery methods (orange juice or ascorbic acid).

```{r load_data}
# load data
library(datasets)
data(ToothGrowth)

# exploratory plot
library(ggplot2)
reg_plot = ggplot(data = ToothGrowth, aes(x = dose, y = len))
reg_plot = reg_plot + geom_point()
reg_plot = reg_plot + stat_smooth(method = "lm", se = F)
reg_plot = reg_plot + facet_grid(.~supp)
print(reg_plot)
box_plot = ggplot(data = ToothGrowth, aes(x = supp, y = len))
box_plot = box_plot + geom_boxplot(notch = T)
print(box_plot)
```
